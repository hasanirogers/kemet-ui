# Flexgrid

Flexcolumn operates in principal like a flexrow except that itâ€™s orientation is that of a column rather than a row.

<br />

## Example 1

A flexcolumn will automatically space each item's height in its container.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example1" story={stories.Example1} />
</Canvas>

<br />

## Example 2

Use `fit-content` on an item to size its height the content of the item.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example2" story={stories.Example2} />
</Canvas>
