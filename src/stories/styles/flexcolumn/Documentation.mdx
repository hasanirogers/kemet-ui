# Flexgrid

Flexcolumn operates in principal like a flexrow except that it’s orientation is that of a column rather than a row.

<br />

## Example 1

A flexcolumn will automatically space each item's height in its container.
<Canvas name="Example1" of={stories.Example1} />

<br />

## Example 2

Use `fit-content` on an item to size its height the content of the item.
<Canvas name="Example2" of={stories.Example2} />
