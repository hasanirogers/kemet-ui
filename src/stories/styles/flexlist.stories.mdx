# Flexgrid

Use Flexlist to take advantage of ordering and alignment while having a presentation that looks like a list. It should be noted that ordering works on all layout types.

<br />

## Example 1

Use a flexlist to take advantage of ordering and alignment while having a presentation that looks like a list.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example1" story={stories.Example1} />
</Canvas>

<br />

## Example 2

You can prioritize elements at a breakpoint using the order attribute.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example2" story={stories.Example2} />
</Canvas>

<br />

## Example 3

You can also de-prioritize elements at a breakpoint using the order attribute.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example3" story={stories.Example3} />
</Canvas>
