# Colors

Kemet's config includes a number of generic colors to use out of the box for you to style with. Kemet will generate attribute values for `kemet-color` and `kemet-background-color` based how you have configured these colors. Checkout out the following to experiment with default values:

<Canvas name="Standard" of={stories.Standard} />
<ArgsTable story="Standard" />

## Theme-ing

Here you'll notice that if you set color to either `foreground` or `background` they colors will change between light and dark themes. These values are special theme values and you can configure Kemet to generate as many theme values as you wish.

Here are the values for these colors:

### light
- foreground = white
- background = primary

### dark
- foreground = primary
- background = white

### Special Custom Properties

Kemet ships with a number of css custom properties that are specifically for theme-ing. They are as the following:

| Property                             | Light Value                | Dark Value                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| --kemet-color-text                   | var(--kemet-color-gray-800)   | var(--kemet-color-white)   |
| --kemet-color-foreground             | var(--kemet-color-white)   | var(--kemet-color-primary) |
| --kemet-color-background             | var(--kemet-color-primary) | var(--kemet-color-white)   |
| --kemet-color-white-to-black         | var(--kemet-color-white)   | var(--kemet-color-black)   |
| --kemet-color-white-to-primary       | var(--kemet-color-white)   | var(--kemet-color-primary) |
| --kemet-color-gray-50-to-transparent   | var(--kemet-color-gray-50)   | transparent                |
| --kemet-color-primary-to-transparent | var(--kemet-color-primary) | transparent                |
| --kemet-upload-margin                | 1rem                       | 0                          |

Notice that there's more than colors here. `--kemet-upload-margin` is a component specific property that changes between themes. You can create as many properties as you need to style your own themes.
