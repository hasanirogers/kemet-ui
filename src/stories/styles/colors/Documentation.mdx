# Colors

Kemet's config includes a number of generic colors to use out of the box for you to style with. Kemet will generate attribute values for `kemet-color` and `kemet-background-color` based how you have configured these colors. Checkout out the following to experiment with default values:

<Canvas name="Standard" of={stories.Standard} />
<ArgsTable story="Standard" />

## Polarity

Kemet has a concept called polarity. Polarity refers to a component siting either on a light or dark background. This is how you control "light" and "dark" modes in Kemet. By default, Kemet assumes a light background, or `[polarity="light"]`. You can switch this to dark however with `[polarity="dark"]`. Use the `html` tag of the document to change the entire page into a dark polarity.

With polarity comes the concept of a foreground and background colors. By default, the background is white and the forground is the primary color. It looks like this:

### light
- foreground = primary
- background = white

### dark
- foreground = white
- bacground = primary

So, in this respect, dark mode is the reverse of light mode.

### Special Colors

Kemet has special colors that are used when handling polarity. They are in the `$themeable` sass map.

| Property                             | Light Value                | Dark Value                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| --kemet-color-white-to-black         | var(--kemet-color-white)   | var(--kemet-color-black)   |
| --kemet-color-white-to-primary       | var(--kemet-color-white)   | var(--kemet-color-primary) |
| --kemet-color-gray-50-to-transparent | var(--kemet-color-gray-50) | transparent                |
| --kemet-color-primary-to-transparent | var(--kemet-color-primary) | transparent                |

You can extend these colors for more complex color swapping between light and dark polarity.
