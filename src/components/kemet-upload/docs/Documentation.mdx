# Kemet Upload

An interface for uploading files (actual upload script must be handled by your app).

<kemet-tabs divider panel-effect="stacked">
  <kemet-tab slot="tab">Usage</kemet-tab>
  <kemet-tab slot="tab">Story</kemet-tab>
  <kemet-tab slot="tab">API</kemet-tab>
  <kemet-tab-panel slot="panel">
    ### Markup
    ```html
    <kemet-upload>
      <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
      <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
      <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
    </kemet-upload>
    ```

    ### Import JavaScript
    ```javascript
    import 'kemet-ui/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload.js';
    import 'kemet-ui/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload-file.js';
    ```

    ### Import HTML
    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/kemet-ui@latest/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload.js" type="module"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/kemet-ui@latest/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload-file.js" type="module"></script>
    ```
  </kemet-tab-panel>
  <kemet-tab-panel slot="panel">
    **Note** Kemet UI cannot provide actual upload functionality for you. You need to write your own upload script. You can do this by listening to the `kemet-upload-change` event. This event will give you the files that have been added. You'll need to dynamically insert a `kemet-upload-file` element for each of these files in the event. [Here's an example script](https://stackblitz.com/edit/kemet-upload-example?file=index.js) that demonstrates how to do this.
    <Canvas of={stories.Standard}  />
    <Controls of={stories.Standard} />
  </kemet-tab-panel>
  <kemet-tab-panel slot="panel">
    ### &lt;kemet-upload&gt;
    <ArgTypes of="kemet-upload" />

    <br />

    ### &lt;kemet-upload-file&gt;
    <ArgTypes of="kemet-upload-file" />
  </kemet-tab-panel>
</kemet-tabs>
