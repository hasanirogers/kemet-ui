# Kemet Upload

An interface for uploading files (actual upload script must be handled by your app).


## How to use

```html
<kemet-upload>
  <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
  <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
  <kemet-upload-file></kemet-upload-file>
</kemet-upload>
```

## How to import

<br />

### JavaScript
```javascript
import 'kemet-ui/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload.js';
import 'kemet-ui/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload-file.js';
```

### HTML
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/kemet-ui@latest/dist/components/kemet-upload/kemet-upload.js" type="module"></script>

## Stories

**Note** Kemet UI cannot provide actual upload functionality for you. You need to write your own upload script. You can do this by listening to the `kemet-upload-change` event. This event will give you the files that have been added. You'll need to dynamically insert a `kemet-upload-file` element for each of these files in the event. [Here's an example script](https://stackblitz.com/edit/kemet-upload-example?file=index.js) that demonstrates how to do this.

<Canvas style={{background: '#eff2f1'}}>
  <Story name="Standard" story={stories.Standard} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Standard" />


## API
